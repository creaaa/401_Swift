    //: ### Exercise 1
    //: Example: Here I've declared one String that forms a sentence that makes sense. I've declared a second String that forms a silly sentence when random words are chosen.
    let nounArray = ["puppy", "laptop", "ocean","app", "cow", "skateboard", "developer", "coffee", "moon"]

    let index1 = Int(arc4random_uniform(9))
    let index2 = Int(arc4random() % 9)

    let sentence = "The \(nounArray[6]) spilled her \(nounArray[7])."
    let sillySentence = "The \(nounArray[index1]) jumped over the \(nounArray[index2])."
    //: Now try it yourself! Declare a new string that incorporates objects from the noun array above. Write one sentence that makes sense and one "Madlib" sentence with randomly chosen words. Feel free to add words to the noun array or declare a new array.
    let yourSentence = "The \(nounArray[6]) made an \(nounArray[3]) about the \(nounArray[0]) in the \(nounArray[8])."

    
    // The developer made an app about the puppy in the moon.
    print("Ex1: " + yourSentence)

    let yourSillySentence = "The \(nounArray[1]) forgot the \(nounArray[2]). Otherwise \(nounArray[4]) to save both \(nounArray[5]) and \(nounArray[7])."
    
    // The laptop forgot the ocean. Otherwise cow to save both skateboard and coffee.
    print("Ex1: " + yourSillySentence)

    //: ### Exercise 2
    //: Recreate the shoutString by using the didYouKnowString as a stem.
    let didYouKnowString = "Did you know that the Swift String class comes with lots of useful methods?"
    let whisperString = "psst" + ", " + didYouKnowString.lowercased()
    let shoutString =  "HEY! DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SWIFT STRING CLASS COMES WITH LOTS OF USEFUL METHODS?"

    
    // Yikes!! DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SWIFT STRING CLASS COMES WITH LOTS OF USEFUL METHODS?It's perfectly cool!
    print("Ex2: " + "Yikes!! " + didYouKnowString.uppercased() + "It's perfectly cool!")

    
    

    //: ### Exercise 3
    //: How many characters are in this string?
    let howManyCharacters = "Hello. I am a üò∏ who don't have a name."
    print("Ex3: ", howManyCharacters.characters.count)  // 38

    //: ### Exercise 4
    //: How many times does the letter "g" or "G" appear in the following string? Use a for-in loop to find out!
